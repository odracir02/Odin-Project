    <h3>Description: </h3>  
    <p>Serrano ham croquettes are a popular Spanish tapa made from a creamy béchamel sauce mixed with small pieces of cured Serrano ham. The mixture is then shaped into small cylinders or balls, coated in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried until crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. The result is a delicious combination of salty, savory ham and rich, smooth béchamel that melts in your mouth. Serrano ham croquettes are a classic dish in Spanish cuisine and are often served as an appetizer or snack with a cold beer or glass of wine.</p>

    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, stirring occasionally.</li><br>
        <li>Add the flour and whisk until well combined. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly.</li><br>
        <li>Gradually add the milk while whisking, making sure there are no lumps. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and pulls away from the sides of the pan.</li><br>
        <li>Add the chopped Serrano ham and season with salt, black pepper, and nutmeg to taste. Stir until well combined.</li><br>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a shallow dish and let it cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the mixture is firm enough to shape into croquettes.</li><br>
        <li>In a shallow dish, beat the egg. In another shallow dish, place the breadcrumbs.</li><br>
        <li>Using a tablespoon or a cookie scoop, shape the mixture into small cylinders or balls.</li><br>
        <li>Dip each croquette into the beaten egg, then coat it in breadcrumbs, pressing gently to make sure the breadcrumbs adhere.</li><br>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a heavy-bottomed pot until it reaches 350°F (175°C).</li><br>
        <li>Fry the croquettes in batches until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels.</li><br>
